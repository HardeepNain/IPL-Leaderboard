# IPL Leaderboard

In this project I scrape the data of all matches of ipl that had been played till now but in async manner.
Make a leaderboard which contains IPL franchise name, player name & his runs,balls,sr etc.

## Working 📝

- It gives output in table format by adding all runs,balls etc. details of each player.
- Means this project combine information of each player and show all of them in a leaderboard.
